## Topics to share!

### duration property and close event
We added new property and event on Notification and MobileNotification components!<br>
You can use the `duration` property to specify the time until the component closes.<br>
You can also use the `close` event to get the timing when clicking the close button.


### input event
We added `input` event to get the value when inserting characters on Text, TextArea, MobileText, and MobileTextArea components.<br>
You can utilize it in case you want to implement "incremental search", and so on.


### version function
Now you can get the version information of the package using version property of Kuc.<br>

In UMD, you can use version property of Kuc.<br>
Example:

```JavaScript
console.log(Kuc.version);
```
<br>

In ESM, you can import "version" from kintone-ui-component.<br>
Example:

```JavaScript
import { version } from "kintone-ui-component/lib/version";
console.log(version);
```
